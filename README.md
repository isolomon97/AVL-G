# AVL-G Trees



A modification of AVL Trees that allows for tuning the balance of an AVL Tree based on a constructor parameter. Simply put, an AVL-G tree, where $`G = 1, 2, 3, \ldots,`$ allows for any given subtree to have a balance of at most G. This means that classic AVL trees can be referred to as “AVL-1” trees.
